## Set up

After cloning the repository, run this to install dependencies:

```bundle install```

Spin up the app by running `rails server`

## Testing 

To set up spring for rspec, run this:

```bundle exec spring binstub rspec```

This should dramatically reduce the runtime of the test suite, which you can run with this:

```spring rspec```

The following resources should be valuable if you want to learn more about how to use rspec/spring:
